**Second Chance** <br></br>
An Android app developed in Android Studio made for the purpose of exchanging second-hand goods between users. <br></br>
The app functions as a **social network** in which each user has a profile and can write posts regarding its offers. <br></br>
The main page of the app is a **news feed** in which users can stay updated regarding the last posts . <br></br>
Each post has a linked **photo**- from camera or gallery **and location**- generated automatically from the user's phone (implemented with Google API) <br></br>
The app has a **map mode** as well - making it easier for users to see the nearest items <br></br>
In this app we managed our data and authenticated users using the cloud services of **Google Firebase**<br></br>
